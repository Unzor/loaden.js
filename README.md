# loaden.js
Loaden.js is a script that lets you add loading screens to your website! 
It is not a library, but close if you want to have your own loading screen.

# How to use
To start loading of screen, put the "load()" function inside the body tag like this:

body onload="load()"

To show screen for loading, use the "startLoadScreen()" function.

And to stop the load, use the "stopLoad()" function.

# Also,
This is not available on npm because I made this on a chromebook and I am a beginner at npm.
So yeah. No npm. Sorry
